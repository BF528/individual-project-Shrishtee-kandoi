### Transcriptional Profiling of mammalian cardiac regeneration with mRNA-Seq

- Roles: Programmer and Analyst 
- Previously performed role in this project: Biologist

In this project, I aim to attempt to replicate the O'Meara et al. results. I chose to perform the programmer and analyst steps from Project 2, "Bioinformatics Reanalysis of: Transcriptional Profile of Mammalian Cardiac Regeneration with mRNA- Seq." As the project's original biologist, I was interested in comparing the original outputs I worked on for the project to the work I could perform as a programmer and analyst.
