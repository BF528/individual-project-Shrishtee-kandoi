### Transcriptional Profiling of mammalian cardiac regeneration with mRNA-Seq

- Roles: Programmer and Analyst

Many newborn mammals can regenerate cardiac tissues after they have been damaged. Following a cardiac injury, newborn mice can repair and completely restore their heart's functionality. Other species, such as the zebrafish, retain this ability to repair damaged heart tissues even after they have reached adulthood. In contrast to zebrafish, previous research has shown that newborn mice lose their ability to regenerate their hearts after one week. According to Bicknell et al., it is due to an expansion of a mature mouse cell's existing cell pool rather than continuous cellular regeneration. O'Meara et al. claim that their findings provide a "critical framework" for understanding cardiac myocyte response to injury, which will be useful in responding to heart injury in adult mammals, including humans.
